# Poker (Java Design Challenge)

### Problem

Implement an object model for a poker game.

### Assumptions

Because the requirement doesn't specify the variation of Poker game that needs to be implemented (Five Card Draw,
Texas Hold Em, etc.), a model was designed such that the game type/implementation could be easily
swapped out for another without having to rewrite the majority of the project from scratch.

### Time Spent

~ 45 minutes refreshing on Poker rules and variations.

~ 3 hours on design and some implementation to make sure the design felt intuitive.
